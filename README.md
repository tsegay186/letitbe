# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

1. Clone and Set Up:

To play, clone the repository and install all required dependencies according to your development environment. Remember to clone the iconclast repo as well, since it's a full-stack app powered by SocketIO.
2. Generate Your Lucky Card:

Choose your fate! Select a card displaying a unique combination of five random numbers. This card will be your ticket to victory.
3. Join the Queue:

Enter the queue and prepare for the thrill of real-time competition. You'll be automatically matched with other players for an exciting showdown.
4. Witness the Fateful Draw:

Hold your breath and watch the magic unfold! The system randomly draws numbers one by one. Each revealed number marks its presence on your card and everyone else's.
5. Race to Completion:

As numbers are drawn, the tension mounts. The first player whose card has all its numbers revealed wins the game!
6. Claim Your Victory (or Learn from Defeat):

If your card becomes the lucky winner, celebrate your triumph! If not, don't fret. Use the experience to choose a more strategic card next time or analyze the winning combination to refine your game plan.

Technologies used:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, Vue.js for that slick interface and interactive goodness.
Back-End: JavaScript, Express.js & Node.js powering the server-side symphony.
Real-Time Magic: Socket.io weaving those seamless connections and synchronized moments.
